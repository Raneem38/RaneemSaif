                <p class = "pa1">Are the foods you're eating really complementing your exercise efforts?
                Nutritionist Claire Turnbull looks at the mistakes we can make, and what foods do 
                help us get the most out of all the hard work.</p>
                <p class = "pa1">I've been for a run, therefore I can eat a chocolate bar. I've lifted 
                weights for the last half an hour, so I really need a sports drink to refuel!</p>
                <p class = "pa1">These are just a couple of the many common mistakes we can all
                make when it comes to food and exercise - and that's regardless of whether
                you've just started a new fitness regime, or even if you've been training
                for years. It can be easy to think that because you're working out you need
                to eat just before a workout, or top up with protein shakes, for example.
                So, what's really best practice when it comes to exercise and your eating
                habits?</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">Mistake 1: 'Treating yourself ' after exercise</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">After you've finished your game of netball, a gym class or a run
                it's tempting to reward yourself with an extra glass of wine or a chocolate 
                treat. The problem is, you can end up using exercise to compensate for unhealthy
                eating habits. You may eat far more extra kilojoules in 'treats' or 'rewards'
                than you've burnt off during the exercise session, leading to weight gain.</p>
                <p class = "pa1">Instead, avoid using food or alcohol as a treat or a reward for
                doing exercise. Think of exercise as just another part of your day and not 
                something 'special' that you should be rewarded for. Think long-term and instead 
                of treating yourself after each session, keep track of your exercise efforts
                for a month. At the end of the month, if you've achieved your exercise goals,
                treat yourself to a non-food-related reward. You could book yourself a massage,
                get your nails done or buy something special you've had your eye on.</p>
                
                
                
                <h2 class ="head2">Mistake 2: Eating just before exercise</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">If it's your routine to eat a snack before you head out for a run,
                walk or sports game, it's best to eat at least 30 minutes before you go. This
                allows time for the food to be digested, making you feel more comfortable, and
                allowing the nutrients your muscles require for exercise (mainly glucose,
                which is found in carbohydrate foods) to be put into your bloodstream.
                If you eat just before you go, the food will still be sitting in your stomach.
                If you have a full meal, rather than a snack, it's best to wait 2-3 hours
                before exercising if possible, as there is more food to be digested. 
                The exact timing will depend on the type of food and how much you ate.</p>
                
                <h2 class ="head2">Mistake 3: Drinking sports drinks</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Sports drinks are very easy to find and increasingly popular,
                but many of us are drinking them when we don't really need to. Sports drinks
                can have up to 14 teaspoons of sugar per bottle and as many kilojoules as a
                chocolate bar. They're not a great choice unless you're doing lots of training
                at high intensity (i.e athletes) or doing intense training (such as running 
                quickly or playing rugby) for longer than 60-90 minutes per session. If you're
                only doing a few, shorter workouts a week, then water is all you need.</p>
                
                <h2 class ="head2">Mistake 4: Eating before morning exercise</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">If you do up to an hour of moderate intensity exercise first thing 
                in the morning you don't have to eat beforehand, particularly if your goal is 
                weight loss. You'll have enough stored carbohydrate (as glycogen) to fuel your 
                body for a workout of this length from the meals you ate during the previous day.
                If you do exercise in the morning, however, it is important to have a meal or 
                snack with some carbohydrate, ideally within 30 minutes of finishing, to help 
                refuel your energy stores. If it is going to be a really hard training session,
                or if you feel like you can push yourself harder, then a small, quickly-digested
                snack may be the way to go for you. Try a banana or a piece of toast with honey 
                at least 30 minutes before you exercise. If you're watching your weight, this 
                snack will need to be considered as part of your total kilojoule allowance for
                the day, so you could try reducing the size of your breakfast or your mid-morning
                snack to compensate, for example.</p>
                
                <h2 class ="head2">Mistake 5: Having only protein after exercise</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Protein is important to help your muscles repair and recover after 
                exercise. But having protein on its own, although it may seem the 'in' thing to 
                do, isn't ideal. If you've been doing a cardio workout (such as boxing, running
                or hockey) or a mixture of resistance (such as weights) and cardio exercises, 
                your body ideally needs both protein and carbohydrates within 30 minutes of 
                finishing if you can. This helps your body to recover and repair effectively.
                Great recovery snacks that fit the bill (containing both carbohydrate and protein)
                include a Milo made with skim milk, a tub of reduced-fat yoghurt or a piece of
                toast with peanut butter. For something more substantial, try a sandwich, wrap 
                or pita bread with tuna, chicken or egg and salad.</p>
                
                <p class = "pa1">If you are doing a large volume of high-intensity training, you are
                best to speak to a sports dietitian. They can give you individual advice on nutrition,
                as it will vary depending on the type and amount of training you do. Visit
                www.sportsdietitians.com.au to find your nearest sports dietitian.</p>
