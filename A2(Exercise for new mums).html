                <h1 id = "head">Exercise for new mums</h1>
                <p class = "pa1">Exercise and Nutrition Scientist Kathleen Alleaume has five post-pregnancy
                cardio and toning exercises to help you lose that baby weight</p>
                <p class = "pa1">Are you a new mum anxious to get back in shape after having a baby? You're
                not alone. But before you begin, it is important that you consult your doctor or
                midwife about the best time to start. This is especially true if you had a caesarean
                delivery. Generally, women who had a vaginal delivery can start mild exercises 
                within a few weeks of giving birth.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">Top tips</h2>
                <h3 class = "head3">Safety first</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">If you get back into exercise too soon and too hard, you can risk a 
                permanent injury. Regardless of how easy or difficult your pregnancy, your joints
                and ligaments have been under enormous strain for several months and any rush to 
                begin exercising can cause serious damage.</p>
                <h3 class = "head3">Plan ahead</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">Giving birth is stressful for your body, so be sure to allow yourself 
                time to heal after giving birth. Use that time to plan your workout schedule. 
                While it may seem overwhelming at first, you'll start to notice a pattern in you
                and your baby's schedule, so you can set aside time to exercise.</p>
    

                <h2 class ="head2">1.  Brisk walking</h2>
                <h3 class = "head3">Targets cardio fitness, upper body</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">Regular walking is a great way to build up your cardiovascular fitness.
                Bring bub along - a stroller provides resistance to help tone your upper body. 
                Start with 15-20 minutes of brisk walking. Increase the length of your walk gradually
                until you can walk briskly for 30-40 minutes. Feel free to split it up into shorter
                walks if that's more manageable.</p>
    
                <h2 class ="head2">2.  Bridge</h2>
                <h3 class = "head3">Targets abdominals, buttocks, legs, lower back</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">Regaining your core strength is vital post-birth. This is particularly
                important for mothers who had their abdominal muscles separate during pregnancy
                (known as 'diastasis recti'). Lie on your back with your knees bent and your
                back in a neutral position: not arched and not pressed into the floor. Take a 
                deep breath in and raise your hips off the floor until your hips, knees and 
                shoulders are aligned. Squeeze your buttocks and tighten your abdominals. 
                Exhale and return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times.</p>
                
                
                <h2 class ="head2">3.  Pelvic tilts</h2>
                <h3 class = "head3">Targets pelvis, abdominals, buttocks, front of legs</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">Since childbirth can weaken your pelvic muscles and cause problems,
                such as incontinence, this exercise is a great way to strengthen those muscles 
                again. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your 
                hands on your stomach so that you can feel the muscles tighten. Inhale while you
                gently tighten your stomach muscles and push the arch of your back towards the 
                floor. Squeeze your abs and buttocks and hold the position for 10 seconds.
                Exhale to release. Repeat 10 times, working your way up to 20 times as your
                stomach muscles gain strength.</p>
                
                <h2 class ="head2">4.  Wall squats</h2>
                <h3 class = "head3">Targets legs and buttocks</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">Lean your back against a wall and walk your feet out in front of you,
                so you slide down the wall, until your knees are at a 90 degree angle to your body. 
                Hold the position, keeping your abdominals contracted, for 20-60 seconds. 
                To add intensity, hold light weights in your hands or squeeze a ball between
                your knees. Repeat three times.</p>


                
                <h2 class ="head2">5.  Push-ups</h2>
                <h3 class = "head3">Targets arms and chest</h3>
                <p class = "pa1">Babies get heavy pretty quickly, so now is a good time to build
                up your upper-body strength. Your baby will enjoy lying near your head and 
                watching you go up and down. Get into the all-fours position, knees bent with 
                your toes tucked under. Place your hands slightly wider than the width of your
                shoulders. As you inhale, bend your arms, pushing your elbows out to the side, 
                as you lower your chest. Remember to keep your bum and back all in one long line.
                You should feel the strain in your chest and in your arms. Exhale and push
                your body back up. Repeat 10 times. Start slowly and build up to three sets of 10.</p>
