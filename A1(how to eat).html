            <h1 id = "head">How to eat for exercise</h1>
            <p class = "pa1">Whether you're going for a walk or training for a marathon, the food you eat plays a
            vital role in how you'll feel and how you will perform. Sports dietitian Caitlin Reid
            spells out the basics of sports nutrition with some simple steps to help you get 
            more out of your workouts.</p>
            <p class = "pa1">Everything you eat and drink has an affect on your body when you exercise - whether
            you're an amateur or a professional athlete. And it's not just what you eat beforehand
            that counts - you need a balanced diet every day, the right snack before you start and 
            then the correct meal afterwards to help your body recover and repair. The following 
            four steps show you how to get the best from yourself.</p>
            <h2 class ="head2">1.  Nutrition for everyday</h2>
            <p class = "pa1">While you might put a lot of emphasis on the food you eat before exercise, it's important
            to realise what you eat every day plays the biggest part in your performance. You need
            to provide your body with a healthy, balanced diet consisting of carbohydrates, 
            sufficient protein, healthy fats and adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. 
            The food you eat before you exercise will have little benefit on your overall performance.
            Eating before you work out is merely the last step to make you feel comfortable and
            confident during your exercise session.</p>

            <li class = "li1">Do eat a healthy, balanced diet every day, made up of a wide variety of foods from all the food groups.</li>
            <li class = "li1">Don't live on takeaway and convenience foods or skip meals.</li>

            <h2 class ="head2">2.  Eating before you exercise</h2>
            <p class = "pa1">Your body can only burn food it has already digested and absorbed, so there's no point eating right before
            you exercise in the hope that it will give you more energy. In fact, eating a large meal 
            will only cause you to feel sluggish and may even cause an upset stomach, cramping or
            diarrhoea. Foods high in fibre, fat or protein take longer to digest and can increase
            your risk of stomach discomfort while exercising so should be eaten long before you start
            - especially if your workout involves running.</p>

            <li class = "li1">Do, as a general rule, eat a carbohydrate-containing meal with a small amount of protein 3-4 hours 
            before exercise, or a snack (such as a banana or a tub of yoghurt) 1-2 hours before exercise.</li>
            <li class = "li1">Don't eat a meal right before you're about to exercise.</li>

            <h2 class ="head2">3.  Eating during exercise</h2>
            <h3 class = "head3">A 90-minute or less workout</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">You shouldn't need to eat when exercising for fewer than 90 minutes if you follow Steps 1 and 2 above.
            If you do feel tired, it may mean you haven't eaten enough carbohydrates before you started, your diet 
            is not well-balanced, you ate too much or too closely to exercising, or that you're dehydrated.</p>

            <h3 class = "head3">A 90-minute or more workout</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">A moderate- to high-intensity work-out for longer than 90 minutes is called an endurance event. 
            Consuming extra carbohydrates is recommended as your body doesn't have an endless supply. 
            To enable your body to access this energy, you need foods with readily-available carbohydrates
            - such as sports drinks, easy-to-eat muesli bars, or sugary confectionery. Research with 
            athletes shows 30-60g of carbohydrates (equivalent to 500-1000ml sports drink or 12-24 jelly
            babies) needs to be consumed each hour of exercising to delay fatigue.</p>

            <li class = "li1">Do consume easily-digested carbohydrate-containing snacks if exercising for longer than 90 minutes.</li>
            <li class = "li1">Don't load up on lollies during a sporting game or one-hour work-out.</li>

            <h2 class ="head2">4.  Eating after exercise</h2>
            <p class = "pa1">How well you recover nutritionally after a workout determines how well you will perform at your next workout.
            For the best recovery after doing exercise, follow the three Rs: refuel, repair and rehydrate.</p>
            <h3 class = "head3">Refuel your glycogen stores (carbohydrates)</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">Eat a carbohydrate-containing meal within two hours of your training. If you're looking for performance 
            enhancement, though, eating within the first 30 minutes after your work-out may be the most beneficial.</p>
            <h3 class = "head3">Repair your damaged muscles with protein</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">During your workout it is likely that muscle protein has been broken down. So including protein in your
            recovery meal can increase protein building. To reap the most benefits, carbohydrates need to be 
            included with this protein.</p>
            <h3 class = "head3">Rehydrate with fluid as soon as you possibly can</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">Most of us finish our work-outs at least a little bit dehydrated, and we continue to lose fluid through 
            breathing and perspiration. Not replacing your fluid losses after training can negatively affect your
            recovery, daily activities and then the following work-out. As thirst is not a reliable indicator
            of hydration, the best way to monitor how dehydrated you are is to look at the colour of your urine.
            The darker your urine, the more fluid you need. Aim for clear to straw-coloured urine.</p>

            <li class = "li1">Do rehydrate after exercising and eat a snack or meal containing low-GI carbohydrates and protein.</li>
            <li class = "li1">Don't fall into the trap of eating food as a reward for exercising. You will most likely be filling up
            on high-GI carbs or high-fat foods and will counteract all your hard work, especially if you're trying
            to lose weight.</li>

            <h2 class ="head2">What to eat...</h2>
            <h3 class = "head3">3-4 hours before exercise</h3>
            <li class = "li1">Baked beans on toast</li>
            <li class = "li1">Roll made with ham and salad, plus a banana</li>
            <li class = "li1">Pasta with lean meat, chicken or lentils and vegetables</li>
            <li class = "li1">Baked potato with reduced-fat cheese and coleslaw</li>
            <li class = "li1">Toasted sandwich made with reduced-fat cheese and tomato, plus a 200g tub low-fat yoghurt</li>

            <h3 class = "head3">1-2 hours before exercise</h3>
            <li class = "li1">Fruit</li>
            <li class = "li1">200g tub low-fat yoghurt</li>
            <li class = "li1">Glass low-fat chocolate milk</li>
            <li class = "li1">Cereal bar</li>
            <li class = "li1">Bowl of cereal and skim milk</li>

            <h3 class = "head3">Up to 2 hours after exercise</h3>
            <li class = "li1">Lean meat, chicken or fish with potato and vegetables</li>
            <li class = "li1">Seafood risotto with a side salad</li>
            <li class = "li1">Stir-fry with lean red meat or chicken, vegetables and rice</li>
            <li class = "li1">Homemade pizzas made on English muffins with lean meat, reduced-fat cheese and vegetables</li>
            <li class = "li1">Roll made with banana, reduced-fat ricotta and honey, plus an orange</li>


            <h2 class ="head2">What about sports drinks?</h2>
            <p class = "pa1">If you are working out for fewer than 60 minutes, sports drinks are not needed - research shows
            they only offer benefits to people exercising for longer than one hour. Therefore, sports 
            drinks are great for the endurance athlete trying to reach peak performance. If you are 
            exercising at a moderate intensity or playing a social game of touch, water is the better option.
            You'll save kilojoules and stay hydrated!</p>

            <p class = "pa1">Sports drinks contain 4-8% carbohydrates, 10-25mmol sodium and 630kJ.</p>

            <li class = "li1">Carbohydrates provide fuel for the working brain and muscles and contribute to the flavour of drinks.</li>
            <li class = "li1">Sodium, along with other electrolytes such as potassium, stimulate the absorption of both the carbohydrates
            and water in the small intestine, as well as make you feel thirsty so you drink more.</li>


            <h2 class ="head2">How to eat for exercise when...</h2>
            <h3 class = "head3">1.  You're trying to lose weight</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">Exercising on an empty stomach causes you to use more fat to fuel your workout compared to doing
            the same workload after a carbohydrate-containing meal or snack. However, fuelling up on carbohydrates
            makes it more likely that you will be able to exercise for longer and harder, which means you'll use
            more kilojoules and be more likely to lose weight. Eating before your exercise session will depend
            on your goal. If you are going for performance improvement, eat something before exercise. But 
            if your aim is weight loss - and you can do the same amount of exercise whether you eat or not
            - leave your food until after your session.</p>

            <h3 class = "head3">2.  You're trying to bulk up</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">To gain muscle, you need to combine a well-developed strength training program with an 
            energy-rich diet that has adequate amounts of protein. While an increased intake is essential 
            for muscle gain, you should not consume a high-fat, nutrient-poor diet of takeaway foods.
            Follow a low-fat diet, include some protein at each meal, and consume protein and carbohydrates
            before and after your strength training program. Carbohydrates help to reduce protein breakdown
            and allow the ingested protein to be used for muscle growth and repair.</p>

            <h3 class = "head3">3.  Your kids are playing sport</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">Kids need to eat a healthy, balanced diet that meets all their nutrition requirements for 
            carbohydrates, protein, fats plus vitamins and minerals. The well-nourished child will be able 
            to play better and for longer, maintain concentration and recover quicker. If your child is not
            getting adequate nutrition they will appear lethargic and tired. Children can overheat more 
            quickly than adults so it's important to maintain hydration before, during and after their 
            sport. If your child is playing in an all-day carnival, low-fat and high-carbohydrate snacks,
            such as muesli bars, bread and jam, watermelon and oranges, are best eaten every two hours.
            Sports drinks or cordials can be used in all-day events, but your child does not need them
            for a 30-minute game of basketball. To help their bodies refuel and repair, feed your kids 
            a meal such as spaghetti bolognese or a ham and cheese sandwich, up to 2-3 hours after playing sport.</p>

            <h3 class = "head3">4.  You're doing intense, long workouts</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">Ensure you're eating a healthy, balanced diet every day, then eat a carbohydrate- and
            protein-containing meal, such as a ham and salad sandwich, 3-4 hours before you exercise. If 
            you haven't had enough time for a meal, grab a tub of low-fat yoghurt or fruit salad 1-2 hours
            before you start. Make sure you're well hydrated, too. Follow up your session with a meal within
            two hours, or eat a snack, such as a banana smoothie or cereal bar, to keep you going until your next meal.</p>

            <h3 class = "head3">5.  You're preparing for an event</h3>
            <p class = "pa1">Your diet will depend on the type and length of the event you are preparing for. 
            Remember to maintain a healthy, balanced diet, and focus on the three R's. The quicker you eat 
            after training, the sooner your body can refuel, rehydrate and repair. Therefore, aim to eat a
            carbohydrate snack or a carbohydrate- and protein-packed meal 20 minutes after training or 
            competing. For more specific information for eating for a particular event, visit www.sportsdietitians.com.au.</p>
