                <p class = "pa1">Exercise doesn't have to be a dreaded chore. Exercise physiologist Kathleen
                Alleaume has the lowdown on how to put the fun into fitness.</p>
                <p class = "pa1">Ok, so you're finding it hard to believe how you could ever enjoy exercising,
                because right now it seems like plain hard work. But as you get fitter, meet like-minded
                people, develop better skills and start to see results, you'll find that exercise can
                be a lot of fun. Here are 10 ways to put some playfulness into your exercise routine.</p>
                
                
                <h2 class ="head2">1.  Phone a friend</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Don't underestimate the power of the buddy system. Having someone to
                exercise with can help you get started and keep you motivated. You can challenge each other,
                help each other, make each other laugh or make a game out of your exercise program. 
                It could also be a great chance to catch up.</p>
                
    

                <h2 class ="head2">2.  Think games</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">When recreation springs to mind, you're likely to picture yourself laughing,
                relaxing and spending time with friends and family. When was the last time you 
                thought about having a picnic? More than just eating, resting and enjoying the 
                outdoors, a picnic can be a great opportunity to exercise - play catch with the kids,
                have a game of cricket or just kick a footy around.</p>



                <h2 class ="head2">3.  Hit the right note</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Almost any sport or exercise can be done to music and you'll be 
                surprised by how much your favourite tunes can energise you. But don't have the 
                volume too loud or you won't be aware of what's going on around you.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">4.  Go places</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">If you usually exercise indoors, take advantage of great weather by
                going to your local park to exercise for a change. Or walk to your favourite cafe or
                local restaurant instead of driving, to build up an appetite for the healthier 
                offerings on the menu. What's more, it's fun to play tourist in your home town 
                and walk around monuments and historic spots. You could also check out festivals
                and markets in your area.</p>


                <h2 class ="head2">5.  Become an expert</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Whatever activity you choose, you will enjoy it more if you learn all
                about it. Search the web for interesting sites; join a discussion forum and get 
                involved. Every activity has its enthusiasts and you will be amazed at how friendly 
                and helpful they are.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">6.  Reward yourself</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Set goals and plan special rewards for yourself when you reach them. 
                Have a massage after a vigorous exercise session, soak yourself in a hot tub or treat 
                yourself to a (healthy) lunch with your exercise buddy.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">7.  Be a team player</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Join a club! You are much more likely to continue your exercise program 
                if there are common goals, you're having a sociable time and other people are counting
                on your participation.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">8.  Mix it up</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Tired of the same thing, same time, day after day, week after week? As soon
                as you feel you're getting into a rut with your exercise routine, switch to something 
                else. Make a point of trying something you haven't done before.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">9.  Go away</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Plan holidays built around fun activities such as skiing, white-water 
                rafting, canoeing, mountain hiking, cycling, abseiling... the list is endless. You 
                can also get involved in these kinds of activities on a one-off basis. Check the 
                local travel agent to see what adventure travel deals they have going.</p>


                <h2 class ="head2">10.  Need a challenge?</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">Consider getting a personal trainer - they can keep you motivated, 
                push you past those self-imposed limits and encourage you to set new goals and 
                challenge yourself. What's more, you'll find it's difficult to slacken off with 
                a trainer standing over you, telling you to do just... one... more... rep! No 
                doubt you'll be reaping the rewards soon after.</p>

                <h2 class ="head2">Getting started</h2>
                <p class = "pa1">The national guidelines recommend the minimum amount of physical 
                activity you need to do to enhance your health is at least 30 minutes at a moderate 
                pace on most, preferably all, days of the week. Start gradually, say three times a 
                week, and build up to every second day, then every day.</p>

                <p class = "pa1">But before you start any exercise program, get the ok from your doctor.</p>
